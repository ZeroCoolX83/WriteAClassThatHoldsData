<h1>Write a Program that Creates Objects to hold Data</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project I am going to write a class named "Employee" that holds the following data about an employee with the following attributes: Name, ID Number, Department
and Job Title. I can't include a constructor or any other methods. Once I have written the class, I will write a program that creates three employee objects that hold
the following data:
<br />
<br />
                   - <b> Name, ID Number, Department, Job Title </b>
                   <br />
                   - <b> Susan Meyers 47899 Accounting Vice President </b>
                   <br />
                   - <b> Mark Jones 39119 IT Programmer </b>
                   <br />
                   - <b> Joy Rogers 817774 Manufacturing Engineering </b>
<br />
<br />
The program should store this data in three employee objects and then print the data for each employee.

#Note: For the output, the last employee's Job Title should be 'Engineer' rather than 'Manufacturing Engineer'
<br />
